In this tutorial, you learnt how to:

- Create a snapshot of an instance
- Launch an instance from a snapshot
- Create a snapshot of a volume
- Launch a new volume from your snapshot

**A reminder:**  
Instance snapshots only copy data from the primary root disk of your instance, not from any mounted volume storage. These need a separate snapshot.
