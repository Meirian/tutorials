To change the resources allocated to your project or to extend the duration of your project you or another project manager can submit an Amend/Extend request.

To submit an Amend/Extend request follow these steps.

1. On your Nectar Dashboard, Navigate to the `Allocations | My Requests` page
2. Click the `Amend/Extend allocation` button.

You will go to the Allocation Request form, with some of your project's details already filled in. From time to time the Allocation Request form changes, so please read or reread the form when filling in the requested details.

**Transitioning to Service Units**  
For all amendments and extensions beyond 31st May 2022, which previously used limit quota, they will have to submit a Service Unit Budget. To learn more about this, [click here](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000257486-transitioning-allocations-to-service-units).
