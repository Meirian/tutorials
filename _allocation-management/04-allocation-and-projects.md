To get a standard project allocated to you, you need to apply for an allocation using the `Allocations | New Request`-form available from your Nectar dashboard. Once approved you will be informed by email and you will be the *project manager* of your new project.

## Eligibility

To be eligible for an allocation you need to fulfil the criteria set out in [*Research Cloud National Allocation Scheme* (RC-NAS) policy - section 7.1](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000191233) & provide this information (e.g a particular grant or affiliation) in the allocation form. If you don't have a suitable grant or support, then you may still be allocated cloud resources at the discretion of your local Nectar node.  (This applies to people at Universities and other organisations that have a formal arrangement with one of the Nectar Nodes.)

## Resource Bundles

In STEP 2: Cloud resources of the allocation request form, you need to select a Resource Bundle. There are four resource bundle options: 
* Standard
* Powerful
* Extreme
* Custom

For more information, read our support article on [Resource Bundles](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000271205).

### Custom Resource Bundle

If you select the Custom resource bundle, you need to specify your resource requirements. You need to request a [Service Unit (SU) Budget](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000257023) in your allocation request form and specify your requested compute resources, for the length of your allocation period. For more information on service units and guidance on how to calculate a Service Unit Budget, view our article on [How To Estimate A Service Unit Budget](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000257485). You can track your service unit usage from the Usage menu in the dashboard graphs on the Dashboard, learn more in our article on [Understanding Your Service Unit Usage](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000257054).

For large requests or requests for advanced or scarce resources, you will be expected to provide a technical justification. If you’re not completely sure just yet, then that’s okay. You will be able to request amendments to your project. We will describe the amendment process below.

More information can be found in the [Allocations](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/folders/6000230417) section of our knowledge base.  This includes the current [Research Cloud National Allocation Scheme (RC-NAS) Policy](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000191233).

## Allocation Requester and Project Manager

The user that requests an allocation/project will automatically become both a Member and the Project Manager of that project when it is approved.

Project managers have access to a few functions that ordinary project members don't have:

- User management
- Project listed in *My Requests*, *Amend/Extend* ability
- Allocation and Expiry process communications

Occasionally you will come across the terms *tenant* (or *tenancy*) and *tenant-manager*. These are alternative terms for *project* and *project manager* respectively.
