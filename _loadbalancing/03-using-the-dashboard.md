### Setting up the private network

Firstly, we're going to set up a new private network to use.

Navigate to `Project` / `Network`/ `Network` section on the dashboard navigation menu.

![dashboard-menu]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/network-menu.png)

On the right side, you will see the button `Create Network`, select this.

![create-network-button]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/create-network.png)

In the window that appears, let's start by giving the network a name: `my-network`.

You can leave the Enable Admin State, and Create Subnet selected. Now, click the blue `next` button.

Let's now create a subnet for our network, giving the name `my-subnet` using the `192.168.77.0/24` private IP range for the `Network Address` field.

![add-subnet]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/create-subnet.png)

If you did not enter the `Gateway IP`, the first value of a network will be assigned by default. If you do not want gateway please check the `Disable Gateway` checkbox. Advanced configuration is available by clicking `next` or the `Subnet details` tab. For this tutorial, we can leave the currently present settings as is, and simply press `Create`.

Your network should then appear in the list of networks available for your project.

### Create a router

Navigate to `Project` / `Network`/ `Router` section.

![create-router-menu]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/router-menu.png)

Select the `Create Router` button on the right side.

![create-router-button]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/create-router-button.png)

Use the dropdown box under `External Network` to list the available networks, so we can choose the right one for our project.

In this example, weâ€™re going to use the `melbourne` external network for our router, but you should choose the network that is appropriate for your project.

Lastly, select `Create Router`.

![router-elements]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/router-create-box.png).

Now, we need to connect our router to the network we created. To do this, click the name of the router you created, and select the second tab that appears, called `Interfaces`.

![router-link]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/interface-highlight.png).

Select the `Add Interface` button on the right side.

![add interface]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/add-interface.png)

In the dropdown box that appears, select the name of the network we created previously, then select `submit`. Yo should then see one item in your list of interfaces. Nothing further required here.

## Creating a Loadbalancer

Let's navigate to the `Project` / `Network` / `Load Balancers` page.'

![loadbalance-menu]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/loadbalancers-menu.png)

On this page, select `Create Load Balancer`, on the right side.

![create loadbalancer button]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/create-loadbalancer.png)

In the pop up that appears, let's add the `loadbalancer` details. For this example, we can simply add the Name, let's call it `my-loadbalancer`, and select the Availability Zone, in this example we will select `melbourne qh2`. Lastly, select the network/subnet that was created earlier as well.

![loadbalancer details]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/loadbalancer_details.png)

Once completed, click `Next`.

Next we add our listener resource details. For the name, let's call it `my-listener`. In this example, select Protocol `HTTP` and Port `80`. The other details can be left as default. Click `next`.

![listener-resource]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/loadbalancer-listener.png)

We now need to create a pool. For the name, let's call it `my-pool`. For the algorithm, let's select `ROUND_ROBIN`.
In this example, the other details can be left as is.
Click `next`.

![pool-details]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/pool_details.png)

For pool members, you have the option to add external instances, via `I.P Address`, `Subnet` and `Port` details. Alternatively, you can add instances available in your project, by selecting the `Add` button. For now in this example, we will not add anything.

![pool-member-example]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/pool-member.png)

Lastly, we need to create add monitor details. A healthcheck is essential to ensure that connections are not directed to backend members that are not responding.

Let's give the name `my-monitor`. For type let's select `HTTP`. Now, we can click `Create Loadbalancer`.

![healthchecker page]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/loadbalancing/my-monitor.png)

**Success!** 
You've created a loadbalancer. Nice work! You should see something similar to below on your loadbalancer list.
