In some cases, you may need to work with the Docker command line interface directly. If you wish to do this, you'll need to ensure you selected a keypair when you launched your Docker Standalone Host, and you'll need to find the IP address of your compute instance.

In our previous example, the IP address was given as the status message of our MyContainer component. It could also be found by visiting the **Project -> Instances** tab of the Nectar Dashboard. You can then use SSH to gain access to the command line of your compute instance. We have a [document on using SSH](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000055446-accessing-instances) to gain access which may help.

Once you have gained access, you can use the Docker command line from here. Docker's [Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) guide is a good reference.
