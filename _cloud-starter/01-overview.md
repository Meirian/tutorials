*If you have never used or interacted with the Cloud before, best to [start with our Prereading section first](https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/prereading/01-overview).*

**Tutorial Series**
In this tutorial series we will point you to a number of our tutorials. We recommend you follow all these tutorials in order.

**Technical curriculum**
This series is technical in nature. You will learn *how* to use the cloud, not *why*. It is also entry-level: you'll learn *one* (easy) way of doing some things, not *all*.
