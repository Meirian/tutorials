In this Tutorial Series you have learnt the basics of cloud computing in the Nectar Research Cloud. We hope you have enjoyed learning and have the skills  and confidence to run a basic Virtual Machine in the cloud, install the software that you need and do your research.

From here you can make things *easier* (check out our tutorial on Applications for instance), or *better* (e.g. add Volume Storage and Move your data around) or much *more sophisticated* (e.g. implementing Advanced Networking).

**Running Analysis? Looking to do scripting?**  
We're here to teach you specifics about the Cloud, but if you're looking for tutorials on analysis, shell scripting and more, the Software Carptentries have you covered! View their site [here.](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/index.html)
