Your instance will now be built according to the configuration options we just set. The **Instances** page will list your instance' details, along with some status information.

**Note:**  
The screenshot depicts mulitple instances in the list, but you will only have one in your list.

Once the Status becomes **Active** your instance is ready.

You have now successfully launched a Virtual Machine using the Nectar Research Cloud dashboard; Nectar has given your instance an IP address, that you will need to connect to your instance.

**Note**  
If using the QCIF Availability Zone, you will have two I.P addresses, one that says `QLD` and the other `QLD data`. The `QLD data` network is to allow an instance to access QRIScloud's RDS collections or UQ RDM storage. Only instances which are permitted to access these collections need to configure and use the QLD data I.P address. A typical Virtual Machine setup does not need to use this, only the `QLD` I.P address is required.
